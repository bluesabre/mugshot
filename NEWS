07 Sep 2015, Mugshot 0.3.0

    able to keep up in its current form. It now uses Cheese and Clutter to
    display the video feed and capture photos.

- Bugs fixed:
  . Camera doesn't initialize (LP: #1414443)

    is a known issue in Clutter that seems to affect other applications as
    well (LP: #1462445)
